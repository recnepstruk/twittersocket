Sockets

-Connections that stay open between a client and a server
-A form of bidirectional web communication
-Uses the TCP protocol
-Provides the capability for real-time communication, like a chat room

To use or not to use sockets?
    -Is real time data a requirement for your app? If yes, then use sockets!
    -Be careful of how much data/bandwidth you're using and try to use as little data as possible, keep your data structures efficient
    -If you do not have a real time requirement, just use polling
        -Essentially just AJAX requests on an interval (setInterval)
